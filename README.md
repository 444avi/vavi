# Vavi

A market-**awareness** monitor for Donald Trump's Truth Social posts. It watches
CNN's free archive, decides whether a post is relevant to markets
(macro / monetary / tariffs / geopolitics / countries / commodities / specific
companies), and emails you the relevant ones with the signal in the subject line.

**It is not a trading signal.** Vavi characterizes a post — category, affected
instruments, likely direction, and a qualitative magnitude (low/med/high). It
never emits fake numeric predictions like "SPY −1.2%" and contains no trading
logic.

## How it works

```
poll archive (~2 min)
  → dedup by post id + content hash   (he deletes/reposts; don't re-notify dupes)
  → cheap keyword pre-filter (NO LLM) (drops ~90% — political grievance, etc.)
  → LLM classify survivors only       (Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6, strict JSON)
  → log everything to SQLite
  → email the relevant ones           (signal in the subject line)
```

The keyword pre-filter is deliberately high-recall and cheap, so the only posts
that cost an API call are the ones with a plausible market hook. On the live
archive it lets through ~9% of posts; the LLM then marks campaign/grievance
survivors as `is_noise` and they are suppressed.

## Data source

CNN's free archive: `https://ix.cnn.io/data/truth-social/truth_archive.json`
(refreshes ~every 5 minutes; there is no official Truth Social API). It is a
JSON **list**, newest-first, ~34k posts. Verified fields:

| field              | type        | notes                                            |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | string      | unique, stable                                   |
| `created_at`       | string      | ISO-8601 UTC, e.g. `2026-06-30T00:23:48.147Z`    |
| `content`          | string      | **plain text** (no HTML tags) but carries HTML entities (`&amp;`); may be **empty** for media-only posts |
| `url`              | string      | canonical truthsocial.com permalink              |
| `media`            | list of str | attachment URLs (may be empty)                   |
| `replies_count`    | int         | engagement                                       |
| `reblogs_count`    | int         | engagement                                       |
| `favourites_count` | int         | engagement                                       |

## Install

Stdlib-only — **no `pip install` required**, even for the Anthropic call (it uses
`urllib`). Any Python 3.8+ works.

```bash
cd vavi
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in your keys (see below)
```

`.env` keys:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required unless you run `--no-classify`.
- `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` (+ optional `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`,
  `SMTP_USER`) — required unless you run `--no-email`. Defaults target Gmail; for
  Gmail use a **16-char App Password**, not your account password.

## Run

All commands must be run **from the directory containing the scripts** — `cd`
into it first. Running `python3 vavi.py` from your home directory gives
`No such file or directory`.

```bash
cd ~/vavi

# Step-by-step testing (what was used to build it):
python3 vavi.py --once --no-classify --no-email   # poll + dedup + pre-filter only
python3 vavi.py --once --no-email                  # + LLM classify, dry run (no send)
python3 vavi.py --once                             # full pass incl. email

# Forever-loop (the 24/7 mode):
python3 vavi.py
```

Flags (`python3 vavi.py --help`):

| flag | effect |
|------|--------|
| `--once` | single pass and exit. **Idempotent / cron-safe**: already-seen posts are skipped, so a second run is a no-op |
| `--no-email` | classify and log, but never send (dry run) |
| `--no-classify` | poll + dedup + pre-filter only; no API calls, no cost |
| `--db PATH` | override the SQLite path (default `vavi.db` next to the script) |
| `--env PATH` | override the `.env` path (default next to the script) |

> **If systemd (or cron) is already running the forever-loop, never start a
> second copy by hand.** Two instances would poll and email in parallel and
> write the same database. For a manual pass always use `--once --no-email`.
> See **Command reference** below.

**Cold start:** on a fresh DB the entire ~34k backlog would otherwise be
classified. Instead Vavi marks all but the newest `COLD_START_BACKFILL`
(default 5) posts as already-seen, then only acts on genuinely new posts going
forward. Tune in `config.py`.

## Editing the gazetteers

Everything tunable lives in **`config.py`**: poll interval, the keyword
pre-filter terms, the macro / geo / commodity gazetteers, and the
company→ticker map. That's the one file to edit to broaden or narrow coverage.

## Running 24/7 on AWS (EC2)

Both services are always-on pollers with **local SQLite state that must
persist** and must never run as two copies at once — so a single small EC2
instance running the existing systemd units is the natural home: no code
changes, and the dedup databases sit on the instance's EBS volume.

**1. Launch an instance.**

- **Type:** `t4g.nano` (Graviton / arm64) is plenty — two 2-minute pollers sit
  idle almost all the time; step up to `t4g.micro` for headroom. ~$3–5/mo
  on-demand.
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2023 (ships Python 3.9+ and systemd; the app is
  stdlib-only, so there's no `pip` step). Ubuntu works too.
- **Storage:** the default gp3 root volume is fine — `vavi.db` and
  `sentinel.db` live on it and survive stop/start and reboot. **Don't
  terminate the instance** without copying the DBs off first; take an
  occasional EBS snapshot if you want to keep the history.
- Leave IMDSv2 set to *required* (the default on new launches).

**2. Access it without opening inbound ports.** The app needs **no inbound**
traffic. Attach an IAM instance role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` and
use **SSM Session Manager** for a shell — then the security group can be
outbound-only. (Prefer plain SSH? Open port 22 to your IP instead.) Outbound
needs are just **443** (Anthropic, Finnhub, SEC, Nasdaq/NYSE) and **587** for
Gmail SMTP submission — use 587, not 25, which AWS throttles.

**3. Install the code and the services.**

```bash
# on the instance (user 'ec2-user' on Amazon Linux):
sudo dnf install -y git             # or rsync the code up from your Mac instead
git clone <your-repo> ~/vavi && cd ~/vavi
cp .env.example .env                # then fill in the keys

sudo cp vavi.service sentinel.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now vavi sentinel
journalctl -u vavi -u sentinel -f   # watch both logs
```

The bundled units already target `User=ec2-user` and `/home/ec2-user/vavi`;
edit them if you install elsewhere. They auto-restart on crash and start on
boot, so the instance recovers on its own after a stop or a maintenance reboot.

**Alternatively**, skip the forever-loop and run `--once` from cron — it's
idempotent, so a 2-minute schedule is safe:

```cron
*/2 * * * * cd /home/ec2-user/vavi && /usr/bin/python3 vavi.py --once >> vavi.log 2>&1
```

**Don't simplify the bulk insert.** SQLite runs in WAL mode with batched
writes on purpose — per-row commits fsync on every row and can hang the
~34k-row cold start for minutes. Keep the batched insert.

The master copy of the code stays at `/Users/avi/vavi`; deploy it to the
instance and restart the units (see **Update the code** below).

## Command reference — both services

Two services run side by side: **`vavi`** (Trump posts) and **`sentinel`**
(unscheduled events). They are independent systemd units with separate
databases but share one `.env` and one folder.

**Two rules that cover the common mistakes:**

1. **`cd` into the project directory before running anything by hand.** The
   scripts aren't in your home directory.
2. **systemd is already running both forever-loops.** Never launch a bare
   `python3 vavi.py` / `python3 sentinel.py` — you would get a second instance
   polling, emailing, and writing the same database in parallel. Manual passes
   always take `--once --no-email`.

### Service control

Every command takes `vavi`, `sentinel`, or both space-separated.

Run these on the host (or wrap them in your SSH invocation):

```bash
systemctl is-active vavi sentinel      # running? -> "active" twice
systemctl status vavi sentinel         # detail: uptime, PID, last log lines
sudo systemctl stop vavi sentinel      # off until next reboot
sudo systemctl start vavi sentinel     # on
sudo systemctl restart vavi sentinel   # apply new code / config
sudo systemctl disable --now sentinel  # off, and stays off after reboot
sudo systemctl enable --now sentinel   # on, auto-start at boot
```

### Watching them work

```bash
journalctl -u vavi -f                  # live Vavi log (Ctrl-C stops watching, not the service)
journalctl -u sentinel -f              # live Sentinel log
journalctl -u sentinel --no-pager -n 50        # last 50 lines, no follow
journalctl -u vavi --since "1 hour ago"        # time-bounded
journalctl -u sentinel -p err --no-pager       # errors only
journalctl -u vavi | grep "emailed"            # what actually alerted
```

### Manual passes (safe alongside the running services)

```bash
cd ~/vavi
python3 vavi.py --once --no-email        # Vavi: one pass, no send
python3 sentinel.py --once --no-email    # Sentinel: one pass, no send
python3 sentinel.py --once --no-email --no-llm --source edgar   # cheapest possible check
python3 sentinel.py --digest-now         # send the pending digest now
```

These are safe because both databases dedup: anything the service already
processed is skipped, so a manual `--once` is a no-op rather than a
double-alert. A Sentinel dry run also does **not** consume pending alerts —
`--no-email` logs what *would* be sent without marking the cluster alerted,
so the running service still emails it for real. (Cold start is the
deliberate exception: the initial backlog is marked alerted so it never
fires.)

### Health check (one paste)

```bash
systemctl is-active vavi sentinel
journalctl -u vavi --no-pager -n 2 -o cat
journalctl -u sentinel --no-pager -n 2 -o cat
free -m | head -2; df -h / | tail -1
```

(Wrap the four commands in your SSH invocation to run them remotely.) WAL
journaling protects both databases across an unclean shutdown, but a clean
`systemctl stop` or `shutdown` is gentler on the underlying storage.

### Update the code

Edit files in the master copy (`/Users/avi/vavi`), then get them onto the
instance and restart. If you cloned the repo on the box, `git pull` on it
(works over SSM Session Manager, no SSH port needed). To push straight from the
Mac over SSH instead:

```bash
rsync -a --exclude '__pycache__' --exclude '*.db*' \
  /Users/avi/vavi/ ec2-user@<instance>:~/vavi/
ssh ec2-user@<instance> sudo systemctl restart vavi sentinel
```

(`--exclude '*.db*'` matters: never overwrite the instance's dedup databases.)
Restart only the service whose code you touched if you prefer — editing
`config.py` affects `vavi`, `sentinel_*.py` affects `sentinel`.

## Storage

`vavi.db` (SQLite) holds two tables:

- `seen` — dedup state (post_id, content_hash) so reposts/re-fetches don't
  re-notify.
- `posts` — a log of every processed survivor: pre-filter result, the full
  classification, and whether it was emailed. Useful for tuning.

## Scope

This is step 1: an awareness monitor. No backtest, no trading, no real-time
latency claims.

# Sentinel (second service, same folder)

A live monitor for **unscheduled, unexpected material events**. Not a news
agent: if it was on a calendar, it's not news — suppress it. It surfaces and
triages for a human; it does not predict prices or trade.

Files: `sentinel.py` (orchestrator), `sentinel_sources.py` (fetchers),
`sentinel_cluster.py` (SimHash clustering + scoring), `sentinel_config.py`
(ALL tunables), `sentinel.service` (systemd). Shares `.env` with Vavi;
own database `sentinel.db`.

## Pipeline

```
fetch sources -> dedup by doc_hash -> normalize
  -> cluster: block on (shared entity, trailing 48h), score = SimHash lexical
     + entity overlap; >=0.72 same-event_type merges, <0.35 new cluster,
     between -> LLM adjudicates ("same event or not", strict JSON)
  -> novelty (new? suppressed? repeated lately? late?) and impact
     (event-type table + multi-source corroboration) scored SEPARATELY
  -> tiers: email CANDIDATE / daily digest / log only
  -> LLM TRIAGE of email candidates: fetches the ACTUAL filing text from
     EDGAR (primary doc + ex99 press release), judges actionability and
     stock direction; non-actionable candidates drop to the digest
  -> per-source heartbeats (fetch failing, or quiet too long in business hours)
```

An email therefore requires ALL of: impact >= `TIER_EMAIL`, novelty >=
`NOVELTY_MIN_ALERT`, entity not in cooldown, the company's market cap >=
`MARKET_CAP_MIN_USD` ($1B — unknown caps pass, fail-open), AND the triage LLM
judging it actionable with confidence >= `TRIAGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE`. Triage exists because
8-K item numbers can't separate "CEO terminated" from "routine director
election" — both are Item 5.02; only the filing text can tell them apart. On
live data (2026-07-31) triage killed **90%** of the 8-K email flood while
keeping restatements, forced exits, and dilutive raises. Its verdict,
direction, and headline are stored on the cluster (`direction`, `triage`
columns) for tuning.

The email subject carries the direction: 🟢 bullish / 🔴 bearish / ⚪ unclear,
plus a one-line headline of what actually happened. The direction is a
characterization of the news, not advice and not a price prediction.

Guards built in: cluster **fragmentation** (delayed repair pass re-merges
near-identical same-type clusters), cluster **collapse** (auto-merge requires
event_type agreement, not just entity overlap), **cold start** (first run on
an empty DB ingests the backlog silently), per-entity **cooldown**, UPDATE
emails only when impact rises materially.

## Market-cap gate

Sentinel only notifies about companies with a market cap at or above
`MARKET_CAP_MIN_USD` (default **$1B**). The cap is resolved per ticker from
Finnhub (`stock/profile2`; free key `FINNHUB_API_KEY` in `.env`) and cached in
`sentinel.db` (`market_cap` table, refreshed weekly like the CIK map). The
lookup runs **only for events that would otherwise notify** (email / update /
digest), so the low-tier `log` flood never touches the API; with weekly
caching the request volume is a handful of tickers a day.

**Fail-open:** a company whose cap can't be resolved — a filer with no mapped
ticker, a symbol Finnhub doesn't cover, a transient API error, or no key set —
is allowed through, so a lookup miss never silently drops a real event. Only a
*known* sub-$1B cap suppresses: the cluster drops to `log` (tier
`log(sub-cap)`) and is pulled from the digest queue. Multi-company clusters
(e.g. an M&A 425 naming acquirer and target) qualify if **any** party is >=
$1B. Ingestion, clustering, and novelty/impact scoring are untouched — this
gates notification only. Toggle with `MARKET_CAP_ENABLED`; without
`FINNHUB_API_KEY` Sentinel logs a startup warning and the gate is inert
(everything passes). Finnhub reports caps in millions of the reporting
currency, treated as USD (all sources are US listings).

## Sources live today

| source | feed | format (verified live 2026-07-28) |
|--------|------|-----------------------------------|
| `edgar` | `sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent...&output=atom` per form (8-K, SC 13D, 425) | Atom; title `FORM - Company (CIK)`, summary HTML carries `Item N.NN` lines inline; `<updated>` = ET acceptance time; accession no. in `<id>`. One accession can appear twice (multi-registrant, 8-K↔425 cross-tags) — batch dedup handles it. SEC requires a contact User-Agent. |
| `nasdaq_halts` | `nasdaqtrader.com/rss.aspx?feed=tradehalts` | RSS + `ndaq:` namespace; ReasonCode (T12/H10/H11/LUDP...); **snapshot of current halts**, not a stream — items persist while halted; company names abbreviated. |
| `nyse_halts` | `nyse.com/api/trade-halts/current/download` | CSV; prose reasons mapped to codes; covers Nasdaq-listed names too (overlap with the RSS is the clustering test case). |

CIK→ticker via `sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json` (~800KB, cached in the
DB, weekly refresh). Scaffolded but not yet built: OFAC SDN, BIS Entity List,
Federal Register public inspection, USTR, FDA, CourtListener.

## 8-K item triage (edit in `sentinel_config.py`)

High value: 1.01 agreements, 4.02 restatements, 5.02 officer changes,
8.01 other material, 1.03 bankruptcy, 3.01 delisting. Discounted: 2.02
earnings (scheduled — suppressed via `SUPPRESSED_EVENT_TYPES`), 9.01
exhibits. Halts: T12 news-pending ≈ the strongest breaking signal; LUDP
means the move already happened.

The `calendar` table in `sentinel.db` suppresses entity-specific scheduled
dates: `INSERT INTO calendar VALUES ('TICKER:XYZ','2026-08-15','8-K:2.02','earnings');`

## Run / test

Same rule as Vavi: `cd ~/vavi` first, and never start a second copy by hand
while the systemd service is running.

```bash
cd ~/vavi

python3 sentinel.py --once --no-email --no-llm        # ingestion only, no API calls
python3 sentinel.py --once --no-email                 # + LLM adjudication, dry run
python3 sentinel.py --once                            # full pass incl. email
python3 sentinel.py --once --no-email --source edgar  # one source only
python3 sentinel.py --digest-now                      # flush the digest queue and exit
python3 sentinel.py                                   # forever-loop (the 24/7 mode)
```

Flags (`python3 sentinel.py --help`):

| flag | effect |
|------|--------|
| `--once` | single pass and exit; idempotent / cron-safe |
| `--no-email` | score and log, but never send (dry run) |
| `--no-llm` | skip LLM adjudication entirely; ambiguous pairs become new clusters. No API cost |
| `--source NAME` | poll only one source: `edgar`, `nasdaq_halts`, `nyse_halts` |
| `--digest-now` | send the queued medium-tier digest immediately, then exit |
| `--db PATH` | override the SQLite path (default `sentinel.db`) |
| `--env PATH` | override the `.env` path (shared with Vavi) |

**Cold start:** the first run on an empty DB ingests the whole backlog
*silently* — clusters are built and scored, but no email is sent and the
digest queue is cleared, so a fresh database never causes an alert storm.

### Installing the service

```bash
sudo cp sentinel.service /etc/systemd/system/sentinel.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sentinel
journalctl -u sentinel -f
```

## Storage (`sentinel.db`)

| table | holds |
|-------|-------|
| `items` | every normalized item ever ingested, with its `doc_hash` (dedup key), simhash, entities, and the cluster it joined |
| `clusters` | one row per event: event_type, merged entity set, `novelty`, `impact`, `tier`, and whether/when it was alerted |
| `calendar` | manual suppression — entity + date + event_type that is *expected*, so it never counts as news |
| `entity_alerts` | last alert time per entity, for the cooldown |
| `source_state` | per-source heartbeat: last successful fetch, last new item, error streak, dead flag |
| `llm_log` | every adjudication the LLM was asked to make, with its verdict — read this to tune `SIM_MERGE`/`SIM_NEW` |
| `digest_queue` | medium-tier clusters waiting for the daily digest |
| `kv` | cached CIK→ticker map and digest bookkeeping |
| `market_cap` | per-ticker market cap (USD) + resolve time; NULL cap = confirmed no-data (cached so it isn't re-queried); weekly refresh |

Useful inspection queries:

```bash
cd ~/vavi
# what got emailed today, highest impact first
sqlite3 sentinel.db "SELECT cluster_id,event_type,impact,novelty,title FROM clusters
  WHERE alerted_at IS NOT NULL ORDER BY impact DESC LIMIT 20;"

# tier distribution — are the thresholds sane?
sqlite3 sentinel.db "SELECT tier,COUNT(*) FROM clusters GROUP BY tier;"

# every LLM adjudication and its verdict
sqlite3 sentinel.db "SELECT at,cluster_id,verdict,raw FROM llm_log ORDER BY at DESC LIMIT 20;"

# are all sources alive?
sqlite3 sentinel.db "SELECT * FROM source_state;"
```

(`sqlite3` may need `sudo apt install sqlite3`; otherwise use
`python3 -c "import sqlite3; ..."`.)

## Tuning knobs that matter

`SIM_MERGE`/`SIM_NEW` (the two thresholds), `TIER_EMAIL`/`TIER_DIGEST`,
`NOVELTY_MIN_ALERT` (0.45 — raised from 0.30 after stale halts kept
alerting), `TRIAGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE`, `TRIAGE_ENABLED` (kill switch for the
whole gate), `DERIVATIVE_ISSUE_DISCOUNT` (warrants/rights/units halting
alongside their common stock), `ENTITY_COOLDOWN_HOURS`, `ITEM_IMPACT_8K`,
`HALT_REASON_IMPACT`, `HEARTBEAT_QUIET_MAX`, `MARKET_CAP_MIN_USD` (the $1B
notification floor) / `MARKET_CAP_ENABLED` (gate kill switch). Novelty, impact, and every
triage verdict are logged per cluster in `sentinel.db` precisely so these can
be tuned independently against real history:

```bash
# review triage verdicts — is it killing things you wanted?
sqlite3 sentinel.db "SELECT cluster_id,tier,direction,
  json_extract(triage,'$.actionable') act,
  json_extract(triage,'$.headline') headline
  FROM clusters WHERE triage IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cluster_id DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

If email volume is still wrong, the order to try: (1) `TRIAGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE`
0.5→0.6, (2) `TIER_EMAIL` 0.70→0.75 (drops bare 5.02/1.01 from candidacy
entirely), (3) tighten the `TRIAGE_SYSTEM` prompt's definition of
actionable in `sentinel.py`.
