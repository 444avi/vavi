Sentinel configuration — the one obvious place to edit.

Sentinel is Vavi's sibling: a live monitor for UNSCHEDULED material events
(EDGAR filings, trading halts, ...). If it was on a calendar, it's not news.
It surfaces and triages for a human; it does not predict prices or trade.

Pure data, no logic.
